##Bringing in the dataset
clutch <- read.csv("C:/Users/Jesse Wolfhagen/Desktop/GitHub/PermuteSeminar-2014/Week-2/clutchsize.csv")
head(clutch)
```
The first question is figuring out what distribution would make sense for the mean clutch size of a bunch of species.
To test this, we first visualized the data
```{r}
hist(clutch$Clutch_size)
```
Our thoughts were either gamma distributed (because the values were continuous) or a poisson-distribution of rounded values. To see which distribution fit better, we used fitdistr() to get maximum-likelihood estimates of parameter values and then used a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test between the candidate distribution and our data. We chose the distribution with the lower D statistic.
```{r}
##Using fitdistr() to get MLE parameter values
library(MASS)
gammafit <- fitdistr(x = clutch$Clutch_size, dgamma, start = list(shape = 1, rate = 1))
poissonfit <- fitdistr(x = round(clutch$Clutch_size), dpois, start = list(lambda = round(mean(clutch$Clutch_size))))
hist(clutch$Clutch_size, freq = F, ylim = c(0, 0.5), main = "Mean Clutch Size per Species with Gamma-Distribution (Red) and Poisson-Distribution (Blue) Estimated Fit Lines")
lines(x = dgamma(seq(0,15,by = 1), shape = gammafit$estimate[1], rate = gammafit$estimate[2]), col = "red")
lines(x = dpois(seq(0, 15, by = 1), lambda = poissonfit$estimate[1]), col = "blue")
ks.test(x = clutch$Clutch_size, y = rgamma(length(clutch$Clutch_size), shape = gammafit$estimate[1], rate = gammafit$estimate[2]))$statistic ##D value for the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test between Gamma distribution and Clutch Sizes
ks.test(x = clutch$Clutch_size, y = rpois(length(clutch$Clutch_size), lambda = poissonfit$estimate[1]))$statistic ##D value for the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test between the Poisson distribution and Clutch Sizes

```
We chose the gamma distribution as the better-fitting distribution because it had a lower D statistic using a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
Question 2:
```{r}
##Problem 2, using this statistic of mean clutch size
#Bootstrap species
mean(clutch$Clutch_size)
species_rep <- sample(clutch$Clutch_size, length(clutch$Clutch_size), replace = T)
mean(species_rep)
#Bootstrap families
family_list <- sample(unique(clutch$Family), size = length(unique(clutch$Family)), replace = T)
family_bs <- c()
for(i in 1:length(family_list))
{
  family_bs <- c(family_bs, clutch$Clutch_size[which(clutch$Family == family_list[i])])
}
mean(family_bs)
#Bootstrap hierarchically
families <- sample(unique(clutch$Family), size = length(unique(clutch$Family)), replace = T) #Sampling families with replacement
genera <- c()
for(i in 1:length(family_list)) #Collecting the genera from the sampled families
{
  genera <- c(genera, clutch$Genus_name[which(clutch$Family == family_list[i])])
}
samplegenera <- sample(genera, length(genera), replace = T) #Sampling genera with replacement
species <- c()
for(i in 1:length(samplegenera)) #Collecting the species from the sampled genera
{
  species <- c(species, clutch$Species_name[which(clutch$Genus_name == levels(clutch$Genus_name)[samplegenera[i]])])
}
samplespecies <- sample(species, length(species), replace = T) #Sampling species with replacement
clutchvalues <- c()
for(i in 1:length(samplespecies)) #Collecting the clutch sizes from the sampled species
{
  clutchvalues <- c(clutchvalues, clutch$Clutch_size[which(clutch$Species_name == levels(clutch$Species_name)[samplespecies[i]])])
}
mean(clutchvalues)
```
