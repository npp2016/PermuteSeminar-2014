Week #1 Summary
========================================================

What we did:
-------------
1. Installed GitHub and introduced how to use a GitHub repository
2. Reviewed the non-parametric bootstrap
3. Worked through several exercises to demonstrate the use of the bootstrap and cases where the bootstrap fails

Basic idea behind the bootstrap:



```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```
